ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) and SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) are advanced time series forecasting models that incorporate external factors or predictors, known as exogenous variables, into the traditional ARIMA or seasonal ARIMA framework. Let's explore these concepts in the context of sales data for Perrin Freres monthly champagne.

ARIMAX:
In the context of Perrin Freres monthly champagne sales data, ARIMAX combines the elements of ARIMA modeling with additional external variables that could influence champagne sales. These external factors might include marketing campaigns, economic indicators, or other variables that are not part of the inherent time series pattern.

For instance, if Perrin Freres launches a marketing campaign during certain months to boost sales, this campaign's impact can be incorporated as an exogenous variable. ARIMAX takes into account the past sales data, the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, the integrated (I) component to handle non-stationarity, and the influence of the exogenous variable.

SARIMAX:
SARIMAX extends the concept of ARIMAX to account for seasonality in the data. In the context of Perrin Freres champagne sales, this is particularly relevant because champagne sales might exhibit seasonal patterns, perhaps tied to holidays or festive occasions.

For example, the holiday season might drive higher champagne sales. SARIMAX incorporates both the seasonality component and the exogenous variable effect. This means that in addition to the ARIMA components, SARIMAX captures the seasonal autoregressive (SAR) and seasonal moving average (SMA) components.

In summary, ARIMAX and SARIMAX provide a sophisticated framework for forecasting sales data while considering the influence of external variables. ARIMAX integrates these variables into the ARIMA model, while SARIMAX extends this integration to account for seasonal patterns as well. In the context of Perrin Freres champagne sales, ARIMAX and SARIMAX would help provide more accurate and insightful forecasts by considering both the inherent time series patterns and the impact of external factors.
